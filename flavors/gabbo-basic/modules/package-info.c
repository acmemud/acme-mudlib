/**
 * The /modules package contians two types of programs: base objects and 
 * mixins. Base objects make up a foundation for the rest of the consumable 
 * objects in the game (e.g. rooms, non-player characters); mixins decorate 
 * the base objects with specific features (e.g. make an object lockable). In 
 * other words, base objects answer the question: "Is this object an &lt;x
 * &gt;?". Mixins answer the question: "Can the object do &lt;x&gt;?".
